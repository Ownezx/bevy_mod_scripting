## Description

>  Contains the platform-native logical key identifier, known as keysym.
> 
>  Exactly what that means differs from platform to platform, but the values are to some degree
>  tied to the currently active keyboard layout. The same key on the same keyboard may also report
>  different values on different platforms, which is one of the reasons this is a per-platform
>  enum.
> 
>  This enum is primarily used to store raw keysym when Winit doesn't map a given native logical
>  key identifier to a meaningful [`Key`] variant. This lets you use [`Key`], and let the user
>  define keybinds which work in the presence of identifiers we haven't mapped for you yet.
