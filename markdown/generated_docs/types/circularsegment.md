# CircularSegment

### CircularSegment

- **arc** : bevy\_math::primitives::dim2::Arc2d

## Description

>  A primitive representing a circular segment:
>  the area enclosed by the arc of a circle and its chord (the line between its endpoints).
> 
>  The segment is drawn starting from [`Vec2::Y`], extending equally on either side.
>  To orient the segment differently, apply a rotation.
>  The segment is drawn with the center of its circle at the origin [`Vec2::ZERO`].
>  When positioning a segment, the [`apothem`](Self::apothem) function may be particularly useful.
> 
>  **Warning:** Circular segments with negative angle or radius, or with angle greater than an entire circle, are not officially supported.
>  We recommend normalizing circular segments to have an angle in [0, 2Ï€].
