# MouseMotion

### MouseMotion

- **delta** : glam::Vec2

## Description

>  An event reporting the change in physical position of a pointing device.
> 
>  This represents raw, unfiltered physical motion.
>  It is the translated version of [`DeviceEvent::MouseMotion`] from the `winit` crate.
> 
>  All pointing devices connected to a single machine at the same time can emit the event independently.
>  However, the event data does not make it possible to distinguish which device it is referring to.
