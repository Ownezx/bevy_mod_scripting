# Arc2d

### Arc2d

- **radius** : f32
- **half\_angle** : f32

## Description

>  A primitive representing an arc between two points on a circle.
> 
>  An arc has no area.
>  If you want to include the portion of a circle's area swept out by the arc,
>  use the pie-shaped [`CircularSector`].
>  If you want to include only the space inside the convex hull of the arc,
>  use the bowl-shaped [`CircularSegment`].
> 
>  The arc is drawn starting from [`Vec2::Y`], extending by `half_angle` radians on
>  either side. The center of the circle is the origin [`Vec2::ZERO`]. Note that this
>  means that the origin may not be within the `Arc2d`'s convex hull.
> 
>  **Warning:** Arcs with negative angle or radius, or with angle greater than an entire circle, are not officially supported.
>  It is recommended to normalize arcs to have an angle in [0, 2Ï€].
