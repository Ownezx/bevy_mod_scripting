# IRect

### IRect

- **min** : glam::IVec2
- **max** : glam::IVec2

## Description

>  A rectangle defined by two opposite corners.
> 
>  The rectangle is axis aligned, and defined by its minimum and maximum coordinates,
>  stored in `IRect::min` and `IRect::max`, respectively. The minimum/maximum invariant
>  must be upheld by the user when directly assigning the fields, otherwise some methods
>  produce invalid results. It is generally recommended to use one of the constructor
>  methods instead, which will ensure this invariant is met, unless you already have
>  the minimum and maximum corners.
