# CircularSector

### CircularSector

- **arc** : bevy\_math::primitives::dim2::Arc2d

## Description

>  A primitive representing a circular sector: a pie slice of a circle.
> 
>  The segment is positioned so that it always includes [`Vec2::Y`] and is vertically symmetrical.
>  To orient the sector differently, apply a rotation.
>  The sector is drawn with the center of its circle at the origin [`Vec2::ZERO`].
> 
>  **Warning:** Circular sectors with negative angle or radius, or with angle greater than an entire circle, are not officially supported.
>  We recommend normalizing circular sectors to have an angle in [0, 2Ï€].
