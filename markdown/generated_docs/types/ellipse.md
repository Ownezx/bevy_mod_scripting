## Functions

| Function | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `clone(_self)` | [No Documentation ðŸš§](./ellipse/clone.md) |
| `eccentricity(_self)` | [ Returns the \[eccentricity\]\(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Eccentricity\_\(mathematics\)\) of the ellipse\.  It can be thought of as a measure of how "stretched" or elongated the ellipse is\.  The value should be in the range \[0, 1\), where 0 represents a circle, and 1 represents a parabola\.](./ellipse/eccentricity.md) |
| `eq(_self, other)` | [No Documentation ðŸš§](./ellipse/eq.md) |
| `focal_length(_self)` | [ Get the focal length of the ellipse\. This corresponds to the distance between one of the foci and t](./ellipse/focal_length.md) |
| `from_size(size)` | [ Create a new \`Ellipse\` from a given full size\.  \`size\.x\` is the diameter along the X axis, and \`size\.y\`](./ellipse/from_size.md) |
| `new(half_width, half_height)` | [ Create a new \`Ellipse\` from half of its width and height\.  This corresponds to the two perpendicula](./ellipse/new.md) |
| `semi_major(_self)` | [ Returns the length of the semi\-major axis\. This corresponds to the longest radius of the ellipse\.](./ellipse/semi_major.md) |
| `semi_minor(_self)` | [ Returns the length of the semi\-minor axis\. This corresponds to the shortest radius of the ellipse\.](./ellipse/semi_minor.md) |
