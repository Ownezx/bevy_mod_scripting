# project\_point3

>  Transforms the given 3D vector as a point, applying perspective correction.
>  This is the equivalent of multiplying the 3D vector as a 4D vector where `w` is `1.0`.
>  The perspective divide is performed meaning the resulting 3D vector is divided by `w`.
>  This method assumes that `self` contains a projective transform.
