# length\_squared

>  Computes the squared length or norm of the complex number used to represent the rotation.
>  This is generally faster than [`Rot2::length()`], as it avoids a square
>  root operation.
>  The length is typically expected to be `1.0`. Unexpectedly denormalized rotations
>  can be a result of incorrect construction or floating point error caused by
>  successive operations.
