# normalize

>  Returns `self` with a length of `1.0`.
>  Note that [`Rot2`] should typically already be normalized by design.
>  Manual normalization is only needed when successive operations result in
>  accumulated floating point error, or if the rotation was constructed
>  with invalid values.
>  # Panics
>  Panics if `self` has a length of zero, NaN, or infinity when debug assertions are enabled.
